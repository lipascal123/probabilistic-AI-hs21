# Gaussian Progress Regression

To solve the problem, the Nystroem transformation is used with a kernel composed of an RBF kernel, WhiteKernel, Matern kernel and RationalQuadratic kernel. The model is than trained and finally predicts the mean and std of the Gaussian Process. Due to the special cost function, means slightly below 35.5 will be increased to 35.5. Means that are below 35.5 will be slightly reduced to avoid over-prediction.
